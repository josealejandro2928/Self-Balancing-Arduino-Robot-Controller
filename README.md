## This project

In this project we have all the codes implemented in an Arduino Mega to control and give life to a self-balancing robot. Control algorithms are implemented in cascade, which control the inclination, the speed of translation and the speed of rotation. Implements a communication protocol via bluetooth using the HC-06 module.
The folder 'arduino_code' contains the main code, inside the folder 'My Classes' there are the classes included in the main code.
